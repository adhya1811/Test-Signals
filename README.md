Sine Wave Plotting Project

Overview

This project demonstrates how to plot both continuous and discrete sine waves using MATLAB. It includes a MATLAB script that generates and 
visualizes a sine wave with a specified frequency and sampling rate. The plot shows both continuous and discrete representations of the sine wave.
